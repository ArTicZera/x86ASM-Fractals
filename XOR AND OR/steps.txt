//ALGORITHM FOR PROGRAM'S SETUP
1 - SPECIFY 16 BITS
2 - SETUP PROGRAM O WORK IN BOOT ENVIRONMENT
3 - SETUP MODE 13H (VGA 256 COLORS --> 320x200)
4 - SETUP VIDEO SEGMENT (0xA000)
5 - SETUP REGISTERS (AH, AL, BX, CX, DX)
6 - FILL THE BOOTSECTOR WITH 510 BYTES WITH 0 & 2 BYTES --> 0xAA55

//ALGORITHM FOR PIXEL'S GENERATION
1 - ITERATE EACH PIXEL TO PLOT IT ON THE SCREEN (320x200)
2 - CALCULATE EACH PIXEL WITH A PATTERN (EX: X XOR Y)

//ALGORITHM FOR VIVID COLORS GENERATION
IF AL IS GREATER THAN 55 --> SUBTRACT 16
IF AL IS LOWER THAN 32 --> ADD 32
IF AL IS BETWEEN 55 AND 32 --> SET PIXEL

//BONUS
1 - CREATE A int VARIABLE STARTING WITH 0
2 - ADD THE VARIABLE TO AL REGISTER AFTER CALCULATING IT

WHEN THE SCREEN GETS FULLY FILLED WITH PIXELS, RESTART EVERY COORDINATES
AND START OVER AGAIN BUT WITH THE INCREMENTED VARIABLE
